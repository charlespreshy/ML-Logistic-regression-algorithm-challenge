DEVELOPING A LOGISTICS REGRESSION ALGORITHM FROM SCRATCH USING PYTHON

This project is about creating a logistic regression algorithgm using either python or R, but i choose to use python as my programming language.

THINGS YOU NEED:

1. You will need knowledge of python programming, statistics expecially linear regression and sigmoid function, mathematics.
2. You will need to have python installed in your system with any IDE of your choice, preferrably Jupyter notebook.
3. Numpy library is an important tool in executing this code.

PS: This algorithm is open to correction and I welcome any meaninful contribution.
